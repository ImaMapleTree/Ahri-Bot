# **Ahri Bot**

###### Proudly used by **{{ site.data.stats.servers}}** servers

##### A user-friendly League of Legends bot for discord, developed for the community as a passion project.

Ahri has a handful of easy-to-use features that provide fun and useful information to users. 

_Ahri bot is currently a work in progress, if you have any comments or suggestions head over to the support server and share them!_

###### IMPORTANT

### This website is still under development, for showcases I provided some temporary screenshots below.
